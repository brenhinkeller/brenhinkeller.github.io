<a href='/images/needle_mts/Eolus1.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/Eolus1.jpg'></a>
The Great Unconformity exposed at 12,000' in the Needle Mountains, where the Cambrian Ignacio Quartzite unconformably overlies the ~1.43 Ga Eolus Granite at Overlook Point.

<a href='/images/needle_mts/Eolus2.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/Eolus2.jpg'></a>
Eolus granite exposure around Mount Eolus, as seen from Lime Mesa near Overlook Point.

<a href='/images/needle_mts/EaMapSmall.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/EaMapSmall.jpg'></a>
The involute comagmatic contact between the ~1.43 Ga Eolus Granite and central Trimble Granite on East Silver Mesa, mapped at 1:2200 scale. <a href='/images/needle_mts/EaMap.jpg'>full size</a>

<a href='/images/needle_mts/TrimbleEolus.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/TrimbleEolus.jpg'></a>
Biotite-rich mafic schlieren at the Trimble-Eolus contact, East Silver Mesa. Undulose lower contact and gradational upper contact indicates comagmatic intrusion

---

<a href='/images/needle_mts/TrimbleSchlieren.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/TrimbleSchlieren.jpg'></a>
Thick, sharp biotite schlieren in mixed or transitional Eolus-Trimble facies

<a href='/images/needle_mts/EEolus.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/EEolus.jpg'></a>
Potassium feldspar megacryst in coarse, inequigranular two-feldspar granite from the eastern massif of the Eolus Granite

<a href='/images/needle_mts/TrimbleModalLayeringSmall.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/TrimbleModalLayeringSmall.jpg'></a>
Modal layering defined largely by biotite abundance in the Trimble granite, scanned from a polished hand sample. Longest dimension is 17 cm. <a href='/images/needle_mts/TrimbleModalLayering.jpg'>full size</a>

<a href='/images/needle_mts/Twilight1.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/Twilight1.jpg'></a>
Twilight trondhjemite gneiss in the foreground of Twilight Peak, as seen from the north. Eolus granite can be seen exposed on the far left across the Animas River canyon.

<a href='/images/needle_mts/UncompaghreCrossbeds.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/UncompaghreCrossbeds.jpg'></a>
Cross-bedded quartzite of the Uncompahgre Formation near Snowdon Peak.

---

<a href='/images/needle_mts/UncompaghreBIF.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/UncompaghreBIF.jpg'></a>
 Basal conglomerate of the Uncompahgre Formation containing cobbles of banded hematite and jasper likely derived from BIF, as reported to occur in the eastern unit of the ~1.8 Ga Irving formation.

---

<a href='/images/needle_mts/SnowdonPegmatite.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/SnowdonPegmatite.jpg'></a>
Syntectonic pegmatite dike (associated with the ~1.72 Ga Tenmile Granite) cutting the Twilight Trondhjemite Gneiss near between Snowdon and Twilight Peaks

---

<a href='/images/needle_mts/IrvingBandedGneiss.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/IrvingBandedGneiss.jpg'></a>
Strongly banded gneiss at the contact between the Irving Formation and the Tenmile Granite near Twilight Peak

Large euhedral garnet in chlorite matrix, Irving Formation near Highland Mary Lakes.

---

<a href='/images/needle_mts/IrvingBoudin.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/IrvingBoudin.jpg'></a>
Calc-silicate boudin in foliated amphibolite of the Irving Formation near Highland Mary Lakes.

Intrusive breccia with clasts of Irving formation amphibolite in a trondhjemitic matrix.

---

<a href='/images/needle_mts/IrvingFelsicGneiss.jpg'><img src='/images/needle_mts/IrvingFelsicGneiss.jpg'></a>
Highly deformed felsic orthogneiss associated with the Irving formation in Animas River canyon.
