<a href='/images/Eolus1.jpg'><img src='/images/Eolus1.jpg'></a>
The Great Unconformity exposed at 12,000' in the Needle Mountains, where the Cambrian Ignacio Quartzite unconformably overlies the ~1.43 Ga Eolus Granite at Overlook Point.

<a href='/images/Eolus2.jpg'><img src='/images/Eolus2.jpg'></a>
Eolus granite exposure around Mount Eolus, as seen from Lime Mesa near Overlook Point.

<a href='/images/EaMapSmall.jpg'><img src='/images/EaMapSmall.jpg'></a> 
The involute comagmatic contact between the ~1.43 Ga Eolus Granite and central Trimble Granite on East Silver Mesa, mapped at 1:2200 scale. <a href='/images/EaMap.jpg'>full size</a>

Mapping in progress

<a href='/images/TrimbleEolus.jpg'><img src='/images/TrimbleEolus.jpg'></a> 
Biotite-rich mafic schlieren at the Trimble-Eolus contact, East Silver Mesa. Undulose lower contact and gradational upper contact indicates comagmatic intrusion

---

<a href='/images/TrimbleSchlieren.jpg'><img src='/images/TrimbleSchlieren.jpg'></a> 
Thick, sharp biotite schlieren in mixed or transitional Eolus-Trimble facies

<a href='/images/TrimbleModalLayeringSmall.jpg'><img src='/images/TrimbleModalLayeringSmall.jpg'></a> 
Modal layering defined largely by biotite abundance in the Trimble granite, scanned from a polished hand sample. Longest dimension is 17 cm. <a href='/images/TrimbleModalLayering.jpg'>full size</a>

<a href='/images/Twilight1.jpg'><img src='/images/Twilight1.jpg'></a>
Twilight trondhjemite gneiss in the foreground of Twilight Peak, as seen from the north. Eolus granite can be seen exposed on the far left across the Animas River canyon.

<a href='/images/UncompaghreCrossbeds.jpg'><img src='/images/UncompaghreCrossbeds.jpg'></a>
Cross-bedded quartzite of the Uncompahgre Formation near Snowdon Peak.

---

<a href='/images/UncompaghreBIF.jpg'><img src='/images/UncompaghreBIF.jpg'></a>
 Basal conglomerate of the Uncompahgre Formation containing cobbles of banded hematite and jasper likely derived from BIF, as reported to occur in the eastern unit of the ~1.8 Ga Irving formation.

<a href='/images/SnowdonPegmatite.jpg'><img src='/images/SnowdonPegmatite.jpg'></a>
Syntectonic pegmatite dike (associated with the ~1.72 Ga Tenmile Granite) cutting the Twilight Trondhjemite Gneiss near between Snowdon and Twilight Peaks

Intrusive breccia with clasts of Irving formation amphibolite in a trondhjemitic matrix.
