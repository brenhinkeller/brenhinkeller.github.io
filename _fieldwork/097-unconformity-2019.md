The Ignacio Sandstone (of contested age, though likely Cambrian) unconformably overlies the Mesoproterozoic (1.433 Ga) Eolus Granite in the Needle Mountains, Colorado.

A closer vew of the nonconformable contact between the Ignacio Sandstone and the Eolus Granite in the Needle Mountains, Colorado. Note hematitic coloration in both basement and overlying sandstone.

Burrowed, mat-like siltstone and sandstone beds in the Ignacio Sandstone shortly above the Great Unconformity.

Spectacular curved burrow casts, possibly <i>Gordia marina</i> in the Ignacio Sandstone shortly above the Great Unconformity. Note the sharp contrast between dark purple hematitic sandstone and surrounding beige iron-free sandstone, suggestive of reductive bleaching and leaching of Fe3+ by chemically reduced aqueous fluids prior to exposure.

<i>Rusophycus</i> sp. (trilobite resting trace) in float shortly above the Great Unconformity in the Needle Mountains, CO. Together with the rest of the local trace fossil assemblage, suggestive of an early Cambrian ichnofauna.
