2010-05-01	Chemical Constraints on the Origin of the Frailes Volcanic Complex in the Central Andean Altiplano Plateau, Bolivia	Cornell University	B.S. Thesis. Advisor: Suzanne Mahlburg Kay	C. Brenhin Keller	Keller, C.B. (2010). <i>Chemical Constraints on the Origin of the Frailes Volcanic Complex in the Central Andean Altiplano Plateau, Bolivia</i>.  B.S. Thesis, Cornell University. doi: 10.31237/osf.io/y6kv4	The Frailes volcanic complex of the Bolivian Altiplano plateau is the largest and most prominent ignimbrite of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone. With 2000 km3 of exposed volcanic deposits dating from 25 Ma to the present, the complex provides insight into the processes of large-volume silicic melt formation in a back-arc setting. However, the voluminous 0-10 Ma main body of the Frailes complex remains poorly studied, as the majority of the literature focuses on a small region of 12-14 Ma Sn-Ag mineralization at Cerro Rico – the world's largest silver deposit. Here, we present geochemical analyses of 25 representative samples from our fieldwork on the Frailes ignimbrite. Whole-rock major element analysis by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy showed the ~ 7 Ma samples to be highly peraluminous, potassic (>5% K2O) andesitic to rhyodacitic welded volcanic tuffs with an Al-rich, chemically reduced mineral assemblage including biotite, calcic feldspar, magmatic cordierite, and ilmenite. Trace element analysis by instrumental neutron activation revealed steep rare earth patterns with Sm/Yb > 5.0, requiring the presence of garnet in a deep-crustal, high-pressure restitic assemblage. In contrast, the presence of cordierite indicates crystallization at low pressure (< 450 MPa), at depths of less than 14 km. In addition, geochemical analyses combined with the geocronological work of Barke et al. (2007) support a recent (~2 Ma) age for the ignimbrites of the main Frailes Meseta. These ignimbrites are consequently best explained by mixing of a mantle- derived melt with a reduced, lower crustal component at great depths to produce hybrid magmas that ascended and evolved to form shallow crustal (<14 km) magma bodies before erupting in catastrophic, caldera-forming events at ~2 Ma.	https://doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/y6kv4					Keller-thesis-2010
2012-05-24	Statistical geochemistry reveals disruption in secular lithospheric evolution about 2.5 Gyr ago	Nature	My first significant computational work - originally a side project to work on as a grad student while waiting for Blair's clean lab to be built. We were surprised by the strength and consistency of the geochemical trends we observed on Gyr timescales. The simplest signals directly reflect secular mantle cooling, but others hint at a change in crustal evolution that appears to coincide temporally with oxidation of the surface Earth in the Great Oxygenation Event.	C. Brenhin Keller and Blair Schoene.	Keller, C.B. & Schoene, B. (2012). Statistical geochemistry reveals disruption in secular lithospheric evolution about 2.5 Gyr ago. <i>Nature</i> 485, 490–493.	The Earth has cooled over the past 4.5 billion years (Gyr) as a result of surface heat loss and declining radiogenic heat production. Igneous geochemistry has been used to understand how changing heat flux influenced Archaean geodynamics, but records of systematic geochemical evolution are complicated by heterogeneity of the rock record and uncertainties regarding selection and preservation bias. Here we apply statistical sampling techniques to a geochemical database of about 70,000 samples from the continental igneous rock record to produce a comprehensive record of secular geochemical evolution throughout Earth history. Consistent with secular mantle cooling, compatible and incompatible elements in basalts record gradually decreasing mantle melt fraction through time. Superimposed on this gradual evolution is a pervasive geochemical discontinuity occurring about 2.5 Gyr ago, involving substantial decreases in mantle melt fraction in basalts, and in indicators of deep crustal melting and fractionation, such as Na/K, Eu/Eu* (europium anomaly) and La/Yb ratios in felsic rocks. Along with an increase in preserved crustal thickness across the Archaean/Proterozoic boundary, these data are consistent with a model in which high-degree Archaean mantle melting produced a thick, mafic lower crust and consequent deep crustal delamination and melting—leading to abundant tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite magmatism and a thin preserved Archaean crust. The coincidence of the observed changes in geochemistry and crustal thickness with stepwise atmospheric oxidation at the end of the Archaean eon provides a significant temporal link between deep Earth geochemical processes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen on the Earth.	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11024	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KellerSchoene2012Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/p9hk2		https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatisticalGeochemistry	Keller-Schoene-2012
2015-07-16	Volcanic–plutonic parity and the differentiation of the continental crust	Nature	Here we used the weighted bootstrap resampling approach from our 2012 paper to address the longstanding question of volcanic-plutonic parity. The results indicate that felsic plutons are not (on average) significantly more cumulate than felsic volcanics, favor fractional crystallization as the predominant mechanism of geochemical differentiation, and suggest the influence of magmatic water content on magma stalling and intrusion. This paper was my first foray into high-performance computing, running ~1.3 million pMELTS simulations to invert for P-T paths and water contents that produce differentiation trends similar to the those observed in the natural dataset.

Volcanic–plutonic parity and the differentiation of the continental crust. <i>Nature</i> 523, 301–307.	The continental crust is central to the biological and geological history of Earth. However, crustal heterogeneity has prevented a thorough geochemical comparison of its primary igneous building blocks—volcanic and plutonic rocks—and the processes by which they differentiate to felsic compositions. Our analysis of a comprehensive global data set of volcanic and plutonic whole-rock geochemistry shows that differentiation trends from primitive basaltic to felsic compositions for volcanic versus plutonic samples are generally indistinguishable in subduction-zone settings, but are divergent in continental rifts. Offsets in major- and trace-element differentiation patterns in rift settings suggest higher water content in plutonic magmas and reduced eruptibility of hydrous silicate magmas relative to dry rift volcanics. In both tectonic settings, our results indicate that fractional crystallization, rather than crustal melting, is predominantly responsible for the production of intermediate and felsic magmas, emphasizing the role of mafic cumulates as a residue of crustal differentiation.	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14584	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KSBSH2015Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/63ycb		https://github.com/brenhinkeller/VolcanicPlutonic	Keller-etal-2015
2015-10-01	Magma emplacement, differentiation and cooling in the middle crust: Integrated zircon geochronological–geochemical constraints from the Bergell Intrusion, Central Alps	Chemical Geology	------	Kyle M. Samperton, Blair Schoene, John M. Cottle, C. Brenhin Keller, James L. Crowley, and Mark D. Schmitz.	Samperton, K.M., Schoene, B., Cottle, J.M., Keller, C.B., Crowley, J.L., and Schmitz, M.D. (2015). Magma emplacement, differentiation and cooling in the middle crust: Integrated zircon geochronological–geochemical constraints from the Bergell Intrusion, Central Alps. <i>Chemical Geology</i> 417, 322–340.	U–Th–Pb zircon geochronology is an essential tool for quantifying the emplacement, differentiation and thermal evolution of crustal magmatic systems. However, the power of U–Pb zircon dates can be enhanced through complementary characterization of mineral texture and geochemistry, as this permits more detailed interpretations of geochronological datasets than conventionally achieved. Our approach to better relating zircon dates and geological processes consists of a multi-method analytical workflow, including cathodoluminescence imaging (CL), in situ LA-ICPMS/EPMA zircon geochemistry, U–Pb zircon ID-TIMS geochronology, and solution ICPMS zircon Trace Element Analysis (U–Pb TIMS-TEA). These methods are here applied to zircon from the Bergell Intrusion, a composite Alpine pluton preserving a ~ 10 km mid-crustal transect. Hand samples of tonalite, granodiorite and hybridized granitoid each record 250–700 kyr of autocrystic zircon growth. Bergell zircons are ubiquitously zoned with ca. 10^4–10^6 yr growth histories, as evidenced by ID-TIMS analysis of microsampled fragments from single crystals. U–Pb TIMS-TEA data exhibit compositional trends on multiple spatiotemporal scales, including the handsample-scale, representing in situ differentiation at the emplacement level (e.g., Th/U); lithology-scale, defining trajectories corresponding to the production of tonalitic versus granodioritic magmas (Lu/Hf); and pluton-scale, indicating increasingly-evolved melts over ~1.6 Myr of pluton assembly (Zr/Hf). These absolute TIMS-TEA temporal trends are corroborated by relative LA-ICPMS/EPMA core-to-rim geochemistry. We compare records of trace element evolution from TIMS-TEA, Bergell whole-rock geochemistry, and a global compilation of whole-rock geochemical data. These findings support zircon compositional evolution as a robust indicator of differentiation at local and crustal scales, and provide key empirical constraints on melt differentiation and cooling timescales in the middle crust.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2015.10.024					Samperton-etal-2015
2016-02-24	Zircon record of the plutonic-volcanic connection and protracted rhyolite melt evolution	Geology	------	Chad D. Deering, C. Brenhin Keller, Blair Schoene, Olivier Bachmann, Rachel Beane, and Maria Ovtcharova	Deering, C.D., Keller, C.B., Schoene, B., Bachmann, O., Beane, R., & Ovtcharova, M. (2016). Zircon Record of the Plutonic-Volcanic Connection and Protracted Rhyolite Melt Extraction. <i>Geology</i> 44 (4), 267-270.	The potential petrogenetic link between a crystal-poor rhyolite (the Rhyolite Canyon Tuff) and its associated subvolcanic intrusion and crystal-rich post-caldera lavas from Turkey Creek, Arizona (USA), is examined using zircon chemical abrasion–thermal ionization mass spectrometry U-Pb geochronology and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry trace element analyses. U-Pb ages indicate that zircon growth within the rhyolite and the dacite-monzonite porphyry magmas was coeval over ∼300 k.y. prior to the large eruptive event. Trends in zircon trace elements (Hf, Y/Dy, Sm/Yb, Eu/Eu*) through time in the dacitic-monzonitic units and rhyolite reflect melt evolution dominated by crystal fractionation. Importantly, the Y/Dy ratio in zircons in both units remains mostly similar for the first ∼150 k.y. of the system’s evolution, but the dominant population in the rhyolitic unit diverges from that of the dacite-monzonite porphyry ∼150 k.y. before eruption. We interpret this divergence in trace element composition to record the assembly time of the melt-rich cap within its intermediate mush zone in the upper crustal reservoir. These results are consistent with (1) a connection between plutonic and volcanic realms in the upper crust, (2) a protracted time scale for constructing an intermediate mush large enough to hold 500 km3 of rhyolite, and (3) the prolonged extraction of that melt prior to eruption.	https://doi.org/10.1130/G37539.1					Deering-etal-2016
2016-11-15	Geochemical Evolution of Earth’s Continental Crust	Princeton University	Ph.D. Dissertation. Advisor: Blair Schoene	C. Brenhin Keller	Keller, C.B. (2016). <i>Geochemical Evolution of Earth’s Continental Crust</i>. Doctoral dissertation, Princeton University, Princeton NJ. 184 pp. doi: 10.31237/osf.io/q7yra	Earth’s unique continental crust represents the active interface between the deep earth and the surface earth system, and is crucial for the survival and diversification of life on Earth, both as a source for nutrients and a component in the silicate weathering feedback that stabilizes Earth’s equable climate on billion-year timescales. However, many open questions remain regarding the formation and secular temporal evolution of Earth’s crust – in part due to the extremely poorly-mixed nature of Earth’s continental crust such that compositional heterogeneity at any one point in geologic time typically dwarfs any systematic variation over time. New computational approaches enabled by the emergence of large, freely accessible geochemical datasets provide a way to see through this heterogeneity and extract quantitative information about underlying processes and variables that drive the evolution of Earth’s crust over geologic time.	https://doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/q7yra					Keller-dissertation-2016

Early Formation of the Moon 4.51 billion years ago. <i>Science Advances</i> 3, e1602365. 	Establishing the age of the Moon is critical to understanding solar system evolution and the formation of rocky planets, including Earth. However, despite its importance, the age of the Moon has never been accurately determined. We present uranium-lead dating of Apollo 14 zircon fragments that yield highly precise, concordant ages, demonstrating that they are robust against postcrystallization isotopic disturbances. Hafnium isotopic analyses of the same fragments show extremely low initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios corrected for cosmic ray exposure that are near the solar system initial value. Our data indicate differentiation of the lunar crust by 4.51 billion years, indicating the formation of the Moon within the first ~60 million years after the birth of the solar system.	https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1602365					Barboni-etal-2017
2017-04-20	Temporal variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history	Geochemical Perspectives Letters	Here we investigated the variation in the amount of zircon expected to saturate from magmas of different ages throughout Earth history by running full MELTS simulations along with trace element partitioning calculations (on a local Princeton University cluster) for each of the ~70,000 samples in the Keller & Schoene (2012) dataset. We found that older magmas crystallize substantially less zircon per unit mass due to the geochemical consequences of secular mantle cooling  -- suggesting that a larger volume of felsic magmatism is required to explain the Archean (and perhaps the Hadean) zircon record than previously considered. We note also that anorthosite flotation crust is largely zircon free and thus invisible to zircon-based crustal growth models, with implications explored in the supplement. 	C. Brenhin Keller, Patrick Boehnke, and Blair Schoene	Keller, C.B., Boehnke, P., and Schoene, B. (2017) Temporal variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history. <i>Geochemical Perspectives Letters</i> 3, 179–189.	Zircon is the preeminent chronometer of deep time on Earth, informing models of crustal growth and providing our only direct window into the Hadean Eon. However, the quantity of zircon crystallised per unit mass of magma is highly variable, complicating interpretation of the terrestrial zircon record. Here we combine zircon saturation simulations with a dataset of ∼52,000 igneous whole rock geochemical analyses to quantify secular variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history. We find dramatically increasing zircon abundance per mass of magma through geologic time, suggesting that the zircon record underestimates past crustal volume even if preservation bias is eliminated. Similarly, zircons were even less likely to crystallise from low-silica magmas in early Earth history than they are today, together suggesting that the observed Hadean zircon record may require a larger volume of generally felsic Hadean crust than previously expected.	https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.1721	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KBS2017Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/cj8eu	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KBS2017.pdf	https://github.com/brenhinkeller/meltstzirc	Keller-Boehnke-Schoene-2017
2017-07-10	Complementary crystal accumulation and rhyolite melt segregation in a late Miocene Andean pluton	Geology	------	Allen J. Schaen, John M. Cottle, Brad S. Singer, C. Brenhin Keller, Nicolas Garibaldi, and Blair Schoene	Schaen, A.J., Cottle, J.M., Singer, B.S., Garbaldi, N., Keller, C.B., and Schoene, B. (2017). Complementary crystal accumulation and rhyolite melt segregation in late Miocene Andean plutons. <i>Geology</i> 45 (9), 835-838.	High-silica granites are hypothesized to form via fractionation in the shallow crust, yet the predicted residues are rarely identified and can be difficult to distinguish within plutons whose rocks otherwise plot along liquid lines of descent. Bulk-rock compositional mass balance in the late Miocene Risco Bayo–Huemul plutonic complex (Chile) suggests that lithological differences within the Huemul pluton reflect residual crystal concentration in response to melt extraction. A compositional gap from 70 to 75 wt% SiO2 and strong depletion in Ba and Eu suggest that Huemul alkali feldspar (Afs) granites are frozen remnants of highly evolved rhyolitic melt extracted from a mush. Quartz monzonites enriched in Zr and Ba with Eu/Eu* near unity are interpreted to represent the complementary residual silicic cumulates of this fractionation process. Compositional variations in Afs granite zircon (Eu/Eu*, Dy/Yb) further support extraction of this melt from a zircon-saturated mush. U-Pb zircon dates indicate that Huemul rocks evolved ∼800 k.y. after initial crystallization of more mafic Risco Bayo rocks, likely precluding their evolution via fractionation from mafic forerunners. This pluton records a means to produce rhyolite in the upper crust, which has propelled large silicic eruptions during the Quaternary within the Andean subduction zone.	https://doi.org/10.1130/G39167.1					Schaen-etal-2017
2017-08-23	Zircon age-temperature-compositional spectra in plutonic rocks	Geology	------	Kyle M. Samperton, Elizabeth A. Bell, Mélanie Barboni, C. Brenhin Keller and Blair Schoene	Samperton, K.M., Bell., E.A., Barboni., M., Keller, C.B., and Schoene, B. (2017) Zircon age–temperature–compositional spectra in plutonic rocks. <i>Geology</i> 45 (11), 983–986.	Geochronology can resolve dispersed zircon dates in plutonic rocks when magma cooling time scales exceed the temporal precision of individual U-Pb analyses; such age heterogeneity may indicate protracted crystallization between the temperatures of zircon saturation (Tsat) and rock solidification (Tsolid). Diffusive growth models predict asymmetric distributions of zircon dates and crystallization temperatures in a cooling magma, with volumetrically abundant old, hot crystallization at Tsat decreasing continuously to volumetrically minor young, cold crystallization at Tsolid. We present integrated geochronological and geochemical data from Bergell Intrusion tonalites (Central Alps, Europe) that document zircon compositional change over hundreds of thousands of years at the hand-sample scale, indicating melt compositional evolution during solidification. Ti-in-zircon thermometry, crystallization simulation using MELTS software, and U-Pb dates produce zircon mass-temperature-time distributions that are in excellent agreement with zircon growth models. These findings provide the first quantitative validation of longstanding expectations from zircon saturation theory by direct geochronological investigation, underscoring zircon’s capacity to quantify supersolidus cooling rates in magmas and resolve dynamic differentiation histories in the plutonic rock record.	https://doi.org/10.1130/G38645.1					Samperton-etal-2017
2018-01-01	Plate tectonics and continental basaltic geochemistry throughout Earth history	Earth and Planetary Science Letters	In this longer-format paper we examine in detail the record of basaltic rocks preserved in the continental crust, building on the weighted bootstrap resampling procedure of Keller and Schoene, 2012. A range of rapid trace element variations in the basaltic record can be explained as a result of mantle melting systematics (changing partition coefficients as a result of Grt and Cpx-out). Both trace element signatures of slab fluid input and major element signatures of calc-alkaline vs tholeiitic differentiation are remarkably stable and consistently arc-like, strongly suggesting the occurence of subduction and plate tectonics throughout the preserved rock record (back to at least 3.85 Ga). While some non-plate tectonic models may produce some flux melting, a virtually constant proportion of flux to decompression melting in the preserved continental record is a tall order for any non-plate model for Archean tectonics. 	Brenhin Keller and Blair Schoene.	Keller, C.B. & Schoene, B. (2018). Plate tectonics and continental basaltic geochemistry throughout Earth history. <i>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</i> 481, 290–304.	Basaltic magmas constitute the primary mass flux from Earth's mantle to its crust, carrying information about the conditions of mantle melting through which they were generated. As such, changes in the average basaltic geochemistry through time reflect changes in underlying parameters such as mantle potential temperature and the geodynamic setting of mantle melting. However, sampling bias, preservation bias, and geological heterogeneity complicate the calculation of representative average compositions. Here we use weighted bootstrap resampling to minimize sampling bias over the heterogeneous rock record and obtain maximally representative average basaltic compositions through time. Over the approximately 4 Ga of the continental rock record, the average composition of preserved continental basalts has evolved along a generally continuous trajectory, with decreasing compatible element concentrations and increasing incompatible element concentrations, punctuated by a comparatively rapid transition in some variables such as La/Yb ratios and Zr, Nb, and Ti abundances approximately 2.5 Ga ago. Geochemical modeling of mantle melting systematics and trace element partitioning suggests that these observations can be explained by discontinuous changes in the mineralogy of mantle partial melting driven by a gradual decrease in mantle potential temperature, without appealing to any change in tectonic process. This interpretation is supported by the geochemical record of slab fluid input to continental basalts, which indicates no long-term change in the global proportion of arc versus non-arc basaltic magmatism at any time in the preserved rock record.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.10.031	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KellerSchoene2018Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/afyxs		https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatisticalGeochemistry	Keller-Schoene-2018
2018-01-03	A record of deep-ocean dissolved O2 from the oxidation state of iron in submarine basalts	Nature	[<u>UC Berkeley press release</u>](http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/01/03/which-came-first-complex-life-or-high-atmospheric-oxygen/)	Daniel A. Stolper and C. Brenhin Keller	Stolper, D.A. & Keller, C.B. (2018). A record of deep-ocean dissolved O2 from the oxidation state of iron in submarine basalts. <i>Nature</i> 553, 323–327.	The oxygenation of the deep ocean in the geological past has been associated with a rise in the partial pressure of atmospheric molecular oxygen (O2) to near-present levels and the emergence of modern marine biogeochemical cycles. It has also been linked to the origination and diversification of early animals. It is generally thought that the deep ocean was largely anoxic from about 2,500 to 800 million years ago, with estimates of the occurrence of deep-ocean oxygenation and the linked increase in the partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen to levels sufficient for this oxygenation ranging from about 800 to 400 million years ago. Deep-ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations over this interval are typically estimated using geochemical signatures preserved in ancient continental shelf or slope sediments, which only indirectly reflect the geochemical state of the deep ocean. Here we present a record that more directly reflects deep-ocean oxygen concentrations, based on the ratio of Fe3+ to total Fe in hydrothermally altered basalts formed in ocean basins. Our data allow for quantitative estimates of deep-ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations from 3.5 billion years ago to 14 million years ago and suggest that deep-ocean oxygenation occurred in the Phanerozoic (541 million years ago to the present) and potentially not until the late Palaeozoic (less than 420 million years ago).	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature25009					Stolper-Keller-2018

The composition of the crust and volatiles migrating through it directly influence the makeup of the atmosphere, the composition of seawater, and nutrient availability. Despite its importance, there is little known and less agreed upon regarding the nature of the Hadean crust. By analyzing the 87Sr/86 Sr ratio of apatite inclusions in Archean zircons from Nuvvuagittuq, Canada, we show that its protolith had formed a high (> 1) Rb/Sr ratio reservoir by at least 4.2 Ga. This result implies that the early crust had a broad range of igneous rocks, extending from mafic to highly silicic compositions.	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1720880115					Boehnke-etal-2018
2018-08-08	A New Workflow to Assess Emplacement Duration and Melt Residence Time of Compositionally Diverse Magmas Emplaced in a Sub-volcanic Reservoir	Journal of Petrology	------	Barbara C. Ratschbacher, C. Brenhin Keller, Blair Schoene, Scott R. Paterson, J. Lawford Anderson, David Okaya, Keith Putirka, and Rachel Lippoldt	Ratschbacher, B.C. et al. (2018). A New Workflow to Assess Emplacement Duration and Melt Residence Time of Compositionally Diverse Magmas Emplaced in a Sub-volcanic Reservoir. <i>Journal of Petrology</i> 59 (9), 1787-1809.	Construction durations of magma reservoirs are commonly inferred from U–Pb zircon geochronology using various statistical methods to interpret zircon U–Pb age spectra (e.g. weighted mean ages of concordant zircon populations). However, in compositionally different magmas, zircon saturation and crystallization are predicted to occur at different times relative to other mineral phases and the geological event of interest; for instance, magma emplacement. The timescales of these processes can be predicted by numerical modeling and measured using U–Pb zircon thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) geochronology, therefore creating an opportunity to quantify magma emplacement in space and time to constrain the size and longevity of magma reservoirs during pluton construction. The Jurassic tilted, bimodal (gabbroic and granitic) Guadalupe igneous complex (GIC) in the Sierra Nevada arc presents an exceptional opportunity to study the construction duration of a shallow (1–10 km) magma reservoir comprising multiple magma batches. We present a new workflow to constrain emplacement ages from zircon geochronology of compositionally different magma batches and evaluate melt-present timescales. High-precision U–Pb chemical ablation isotope dilution (CA-ID)-TIMS zircon ages are combined with MELTS modeling to calculate zircon saturation ages for each dated sample. Bayesian statistics are then used to compare calculated zircon saturation distributions with zircon age distributions from TIMS data to predict time, temperature, and melt fraction at zircon saturation and solidus. In addition, we use mineral thermometry and cooling rate calculations to relate zircon saturation ages to emplacement ages for felsic and mafic rocks, resulting in a best estimate for the total construction duration of 295 ± 110 kyr for the GIC. Rhyolites exposed at the top of the GIC are ∼2–3 Myr older and thus not part of the same magmatic system. The good agreement between Ti-in-zircon crystallization temperatures and calculated zircon saturation temperatures by MELTS implies that bulk-rock compositions of both mafic and felsic rocks are close to liquid compositions. Mafic and felsic magmas experienced extensive mingling at the emplacement level in a magma chamber (which, as defined here, has temperatures above the solidus of the respective rock composition) encompassing ∼60% of the exposed map area of the complex shortly after construction. Melt was present within the system for a total duration of ∼550 kyr as constrained by two-dimensional thermal finite-difference modeling using an incremental growth and sill emplacement model. The construction and melt-present timescales calculated in this study for the shallow GIC have implications for the potential of in situ differentiation, mixing and mingling timescales and eruption in shallow magmatic systems.	https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egy079					Ratschbaher-etal-2018

The 238U decay constant (λU-238) is fundamental to radioisotope-based chronometry in the Earth and planetary sciences, yet only a single published λU-238 value (Jaffey et al. in Phys Rev C 4(5):1889–1906, 1971) is widely applied. We have determined λU-238 via the novel approach of measuring of 234Th ingrowth in high-purity 238U solutions, using isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS). The 234Th decay constant (λTh-234) was measured via decay counting with high-purity Ge (HPGe) γ detectors. Preliminary results for λU-238 agree with the value determined by α-counting within the elevated uncertainty of 0.462% (k = 2). Ongoing efforts to reproduce λU-238 with reduced experimental uncertainties will inform future conclusions.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10967-018-6148-y					Parsons-Davis-etal-2018

A Stochastic Sampling Approach to Zircon Eruption Age Interpretation. <i>Geochemical Persectives Letters</i> 8, 31–35	The accessory mineral zircon is widely used to constrain the timing of igneous processes such as magma crystallisation or eruption. However, zircon U-Pb ages record zircon crystallisation, which is not an instantaneous process. Zircon saturation calculations link zircon crystallisation, temperature, and melt fraction, allowing for the estimation of zircon crystallisation distributions as a function of time or temperature. Such distributions provide valuable prior information, enabling Bayesian estimates of magma eruption time and allowing for comparison of the relative accuracy of common weighted-mean and youngest-zircon age interpretations with synthetic datasets. We find that both traditional interpretations carry a risk of underestimating the uncertainty in eruption age; a low mean square of weighted deviates (MSWD) does not guarantee the accuracy of weighted-mean interpretations. In the absence of independent confirmation that crystallisation timescale is short relative to analytical uncertainties, a Bayesian approach frequently provides the most accurate results and is least likely to underestimate uncertainty. Since U-Pb zircon studies now routinely resolve geological age dispersion due to increasing analytical precision, such considerations are increasingly critical to future progress in resolving rates and dates of Earth processes.	https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.1826	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KSS2018Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/aws79	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KSS2018.pdf	https://github.com/brenhinkeller/BayeZirChron.c	Keller-Schoene-Samperton-2018

Brenhin Keller	Keller, C.B. (2018). <i>Chron.jl: A Bayesian framework for integrated eruption age and age-depth modelling</i>.  https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/TQX3F	Chron.jl provides a two-part framework for (1) estimating eruption/deposition age distributions from complex mineral age spectra and (2) subsequently building a stratigraphic age model based on those distributions. Each step relies on a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo model. The first (distribution) MCMC model is based on the work of [Keller, Schoene, and Samperton (2018)]( https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.1826) and uses information about the possible form of the true mineral crystallization (or closure) age distribution (e.g., no crystallization possible after eruption or deposition). In this first model, the true eruption or deposition age is a parameter of this scaled crystallization distribution. The stationary distribution of this first MCMC model then gives an estimate of the eruption/deposition age. The second (stratigraphic) MCMC  model uses the estimated (posterior) eruption/deposition age distributions along with the constraint of stratigraphic superposition to produce an age-depth model.	https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/TQX3F				https://github.com/brenhinkeller/Chron.jl	Chron-2018
2019-01-22	Neoproterozoic glacial origin of the Great Unconformity	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	It has long been observed that the sequence of sedimentary rocks deposited in the past half-billion years often sharply overlies older igneous or metamorphic basement at an erosional surface known as the Great Unconformity. We provide evidence that this unconformity may record rapid erosion during Neoproterozoic “snowball Earth” glaciations. We show that the extent of Phanerozoic sedimentation in shallow continental seas can be accurately reproduced by modeling the accommodation space produced by the proposed glacial erosion, underlining the importance of glaciation as a means for lowering erosional base level. These results provide constraints on the sedimentary and geochemical environment in which the first multicellular animals evolved and diversified in the “Cambrian explosion” following the unconformity.

Neoproterozoic glacial origin of the Great Unconformity. <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> 116 (4), 1136-1145.	The Great Unconformity, a profound gap in Earth’s stratigraphic record often evident below the base of the Cambrian system, has remained among the most enigmatic field observations in Earth science for over a century. While long associated directly or indirectly with the occurrence of the earliest complex animal fossils, a conclusive explanation for the formation and global extent of the Great Unconformity has remained elusive. Here we show that the Great Unconformity is associated with a set of large global oxygen and hafnium isotope excursions in magmatic zircon that suggest a late Neoproterozoic crustal erosion and sediment subduction event of unprecedented scale. These excursions, the Great Unconformity, preservational irregularities in the terrestrial bolide impact record, and the first-order pattern of Phanerozoic sedimentation can together be explained by spatially heterogeneous Neoproterozoic glacial erosion totaling a global average of 3–5 vertical kilometers, along with the subsequent thermal and isostatic consequences of this erosion for global continental freeboard.	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1804350116	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/GreatUnconformity2019Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/4k6pd	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/GreatUnconformity2019.pdf	https://github.com/brenhinkeller/GreatUnconformity	GreatUnconformity-2019

Temporal correlation between some continental flood basalt eruptions and mass extinctions has been proposed to indicate causality, with eruptive volatile release driving environmental degradation and extinction. We tested this model for the Deccan Traps flood basalt province, which, along with the Chicxulub bolide impact, is implicated in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction approximately 66 million years ago. We estimated Deccan eruption rates with uranium-lead (U-Pb) zircon geochronology and resolved four high-volume eruptive periods. According to this model, maximum eruption rates occurred before and after the K-Pg extinction, with one such pulse initiating tens of thousands of years prior to both the bolide impact and extinction. These findings support extinction models that incorporate both catastrophic events as drivers of environmental deterioration associated with the K-Pg extinction and its aftermath.	https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau2422					Schoene-etal-2019

Brenhin Keller, Richard Potts, Anna Behrensmeyer, Emily Beverly, John King, Clifford Heil, Mona Stockhecke, Erik Brown, Jessica Moerman, Peter de Menocal, and the Olorgesailie Drilling Project Scientific Team	Deino, A.L., Dommain, R., Keller, C.B., Potts, R., Behrensmeyer, A.K., Beverly, E.J., King, J., Heil, C.W., Stockhecke, M., Brown, E.T., Moerman, J., de Menocal, P., Levin, N.E., & ODP Scientific Team.

Chronostratigraphic model of a high-resolution drill core record of the past million years from the Koora Basin, south Kenya Rift: Overcoming the difficulties of variable sedimentation rate and hiatuses. <i>Quaternary Science Reviews</i> 215, 213–231.	The Olorgesailie Drilling Project and the related Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project in East Africa were initiated to test hypotheses and models linking environmental change to hominin evolution by drilling lake basin sediments adjacent to important archeological and paleoanthropological sites. Drill core OLO12-1A recovered 139 m of sedimentary and volcaniclastic strata from the Koora paleolake basin, southern Kenya Rift, providing the opportunity to compare paleoenvironmental influences over the past million years with the parallel record exposed at the nearby Olorgesailie archeological site. To refine our ability to link core-to-outcrop paleoenvironmental records, we institute here a methodological framework for deriving a robust age model for the complex lithostratigraphy of OLO12-1A. Firstly, chronostratigraphic control points for the core were established based on 40Ar/39Ar ages from intercalated tephra deposits and a basal trachyte flow, as well as the stratigraphic position of the Brunhes-Matuyama geomagnetic reversal. This dataset was combined with the position and duration of paleosols, and analyzed using a new Bayesian algorithm for high-resolution age-depth modelling of hiatus-bearing stratigraphic sections. This model addresses three important aspects relevant to highly dynamic, non-linear depositional environments: 1) correcting for variable rates of deposition, 2) accommodating hiatuses, and 3) quantifying realistic age uncertainty with centimetric resolution. Our method is applicable to typical depositional systems in extensional rifts as well as to drill cores from other dynamic terrestrial or aquatic environments. We use the core age model and lithostratigraphy to examine the interconnectivity of the Koora Basin to adjacent areas and sources of volcanism.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.05.009					Deino-etal-2019a

(2019). Coupled stratigraphic and U-Pb zircon age constraints on the late Paleozoic icehouse-to-greenhouse turnover in south-central Gondwana. <i>Geology</i> 47 (12), 1146–1150.	The demise of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age has been hypothesized as diachronous, occurring first in western South America and progressing eastward across Africa and culminating in Australia over an ~60 m.y. period, suggesting tectonic forcing mechanisms that operate on time scales of 106 yr or longer. We test this diachronous deglaciation hypothesis for southwestern and south-central Gondwana with new single crystal U-Pb zircon chemical abrasion thermal ionizing mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) ages from volcaniclastic deposits in the Paraná (Brazil) and Karoo (South Africa) Basins that span the terminal deglaciation through the early postglacial period. Intrabasinal stratigraphic correlations permitted by the new high-resolution radioisotope ages indicate that deglaciation across the south to southeast Paraná Basin was synchronous, with glaciation constrained to the Carboniferous. Cross-basin correlation reveals two additional glacial-deglacial cycles in the Karoo Basin after the terminal deglaciation in the Paraná Basin. South African glaciations were penecontemporaneous (within U-Pb age uncertainties) with third-order sequence boundaries (i.e., inferred base-level falls) in the Paraná Basin. Synchroneity between early Permian glacial-deglacial events in southwestern to south-central Gondwana and pCO2 fluctuations suggest a primary CO2 control on ice thresholds. The occurrence of renewed glaciation in the Karoo Basin, after terminal deglaciation in the Paraná Basin, reflects the secondary influences of regional paleogeography, topography, and moisture sources.	https://doi.org/10.1130/G46740.1					Griffis-etal-2019

Chronostratigraphy of the Baringo-Tugen-Barsemoi (HSPDP-BTB13-1A) core – 40Ar/39Ar dating, magnetostratigraphy, tephrostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy and Bayesian age modeling. <i>Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology</i> 523, 109258.	The Baringo-Tugen-Barsemoi 2013 drillcore (BTB13), acquired as part of the Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project, recovered 228 m of fluviolacustrine sedimentary rocks and tuffs spanning a ~3.29–2.56 Ma interval of the highly fossiliferous and hominin-bearing Chemeron Formation, Tugen Hills, Kenya. Here we present a Bayesian stratigraphic age model for the core employing chronostratigraphic control points derived from 40Ar/39Ar dating of tuffs from core and outcrop, 40Ar/39Ar age calibration of related outcrop diatomaceous units, and core magnetostratigraphy. The age model reveals three main intervals with distinct sediment accumulation rates: an early rapid phase from 3.2 to 2.9 Ma; a relatively slow phase from 2.9 to 2.7 Ma; and the highest rate of accumulation from 2.7 to 2.6 Ma. The intervals of rapid accumulation correspond to periods of high Earth orbital eccentricity, whereas the slow accumulation interval corresponds to low eccentricity at 2.9–2.7 Ma, suggesting that astronomically mediated climate processes may be responsible for the observed changes in sediment accumulation rate. Lacustrine transgression-regression events, as delineated using sequence stratigraphy, dominantly operate on precession scale, particularly within the high eccentricity periods. A set of erosively based fluvial conglomerates correspond to the 2.9–2.7 Ma interval, which could be related to either the depositional response to low eccentricity or to the development of unconformities due to local tectonic activity. Age calibration of core magnetic susceptibility and gamma density logs indicates a close temporal correspondence between a shift from high- to low-frequency signal variability at ~3 Ma, approximately coincident the end of the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period, and the beginning of the cooling of world climate leading to the initiation of Northern Hemispheric glaciation c. 2.7 Ma. BTB13 and the Baringo Basin records may thus provide evidence of a connection between high-latitude glaciation and equatorial terrestrial climate toward the end of the Pliocene.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109519					Deino-etal-2019b
2019-12-11	Stepwise chemical abrasion–isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry with trace element analysis of microfractured Hadean zircon	Geochronology	The oldest known minerals on Earth are Hadean (> 4.0 Ga) zircons from the Jack Hills, Australia. We present the first application to such Hadean zircons of stepwise chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry with trace element analysis (stepwise CA-ID-TIMS-TEA). We examine the evolution in U-Pb age and trace element chemistry of zircon domains accessed by successive chemical abrasion steps in the context of the geologic history of the Jack Hills zircons.	C. Brenhin Keller, Patrick Boehnke, Blair Schoene, and T. Mark Harrison	Keller, C.B., Boehnke, P., Schoene, B., and Harrison, T.M. (2019) Stepwise chemical abrasion–isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry with trace element analysis of microfractured Hadean zircon, <i>Geochronology</i> 1 (1), 85–97.	The Hadean Jack Hills zircons represent the oldest known terrestrial material, providing a unique and truly direct record of Hadean Earth history. This zircon population has been extensively studied via high spatial resolution, high throughput in situ isotopic and elemental analysis techniques such as secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS), but not by comparatively destructive, high-temporal-precision (< 0.05 % two-sigma) thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). In order to better understand the lead loss and alteration history of terrestrial Hadean zircons, we conduct stepwise chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry with trace element analysis (CA-ID-TIMS-TEA) on manually microfractured Hadean Jack Hills zircon fragments previously dated by SIMS. We conducted three successive HF leaching steps on each individual zircon fragment, followed by column chromatography to isolate U-Pb and trace element fractions. Following isotopic and elemental analysis, the result is an independent age and trace element composition for each leachate of each zircon fragment. We observe ~ 50 Myr of age heterogeneity in concordant residues from a single zircon grain, along with a protracted history of post-Hadean Pb-loss with at least two modes circa ~0 and 2–4 Ga. Meanwhile, step-wise leachate trace element chemistry reveals enrichments of light rare earth elements, uranium, thorium, and radiogenic lead in early leached domains relative to the zircon residue. In addition to confirming the efficacy of the LREE-I alteration index and providing new insight into the mechanism of chemical abrasion, the interpretation and reconciliation of these results suggests that Pb-loss is largely driven by low-temperature aqueous recrystallization, and that regional thermal events may act to halt – not initiate – Pb-loss from metamict domains in the Hadean Jack Hills zircons.	https://doi.org/10.5194/gchron-1-85-2019	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KBSH2019Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/gzr43	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KBSH2019.pdf	https://github.com/brenhinkeller/JackHillsTIMS-TEA	Keller-etal-2019
2020-08-17	Constraining crustal silica on ancient Earth	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	On geologic timescales, Earth’s habitable climate is maintained by a negative feedback process wherein atmospheric CO₂ is consumed by reaction with silicate rocks during erosion and weathering. However, relative to modern continental crust, many models propose an ancient crust that was thinner, denser, and significantly lower in silica for the first 1 to 2 billion years of Earth history. Like modern oceanic crust, such mafic crust would likely be poorly exposed to the atmosphere, resulting in a less climatically stable early Earth. We find that two geologic processes (mantle cooling and atmospheric oxidation) significantly compromise some previous methods for estimating ancient crustal composition. Accounting for these factors results in estimates much closer to the composition of modern continental crust.	C. Brenhin Keller and T. Mark Harrison	Keller, C.B. and Harrison, T.M. (2020). Constraining crustal silica on ancient Earth. <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> 117 (35), 21101–21107.	Accurately quantifying the composition of continental crust on Hadean and Archean Earth is critical to our understanding of the physiography, tectonics, and climate of our planet at the dawn of life. One longstanding paradigm involves the growth of a relatively mafic planetary crust over the first 1 to 2 billion years of Earth history, implying a lack of modern plate tectonics and a paucity of subaerial crust, and consequently lacking an efficient mechanism to regulate climate. Others have proposed a more uniformitarian view in which Archean and Hadean continents were only slightly more mafic than at present. Apart from complications in assessing early crustal composition introduced by crustal preservation and sampling biases, effects such as the secular cooling of Earth’s mantle and the biologically driven oxidation of Earth’s atmosphere have not been fully investigated. We find that the former complicates efforts to infer crustal silica from compatible or incompatible element abundances, while the latter undermines estimates of crustal silica content inferred from terrigenous sediments. Accounting for these complications, we find that the data are most parsimoniously explained by a model with nearly constant crustal silica since at least the early Archean.	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009431117	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KellerHarrison2020Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/75evw		https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatGeochem.jl	Keller-Harrison-2020

Increased ecological resource variability during a critical transition in hominin evolution. <i>Science Advances</i> 6 (43), eabc8975	Although climate change is considered to have been a large-scale driver of African human evolution, landscape-scale shifts in ecological resources that may have shaped novel hominin adaptations are rarely investigated. We use well-dated, high-resolution, drill-core datasets to understand ecological dynamics associated with a major adaptive transition in the archeological record ~24 km from the coring site. Outcrops preserve evidence of the replacement of Acheulean by Middle Stone Age (MSA) technological, cognitive, and social innovations between 500 and 300 thousand years (ka) ago, contemporaneous with large-scale taxonomic and adaptive turnover in mammal herbivores. Beginning ~400 ka ago, tectonic, hydrological, and ecological changes combined to disrupt a relatively stable resource base, prompting fluctuations of increasing magnitude in freshwater availability, grassland communities, and woody plant cover. Interaction of these factors offers a resource-oriented hypothesis for the evolutionary success of MSA adaptations, which likely contributed to the ecological flexibility typical of Homo sapiens foragers.	https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc8975					Potts-etal-2020

The nature of Earth’s earliest crust and the processes by which it formed remain major issues in Precambrian geology. Due to the absence of a rock record older than ∼4.02 Ga, the only direct record of the Hadean is from rare detrital zircon and that largely from a single area: the Jack Hills and Mount Narryer region of Western Australia. Here, we report on the geochemistry of Hadean detrital zircons as old as 4.15 Ga from the newly discovered Green Sandstone Bed in the Barberton greenstone belt, South Africa. We demonstrate that the U-Nb-Sc-Yb systematics of the majority of these Hadean zircons show a mantle affinity as seen in zircon from modern plume-type mantle environments and do not resemble zircon from modern continental or oceanic arcs. The zircon trace element compositions furthermore suggest magma compositions ranging from higher temperature, primitive to lower temperature, and more evolved tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG)-like magmas that experienced some reworking of hydrated crust. We propose that the Hadean parental magmas of the Green Sandstone Bed zircons formed from remelting of mafic, mantle-derived crust that experienced some hydrous input during melting but not from the processes seen in modern arc magmatism.	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004370118					Drabon-etal-2021

(2021) The composition and weathering of the continents over geologic time. <i>Geochemical Perspectives Letters</i> 17, 21–26.	The composition of continental crust records the balance between construction by tectonics and destruction by physical and chemical erosion. Quantitative constraints on how igneous addition and chemical weathering have modified the continents’ bulk composition are essential for understanding the evolution of geodynamics and climate. Using novel data analytic techniques we have extracted temporal trends in sediments’ protolith composition and weathering intensity from the largest available compilation of sedimentary major element compositions: ∼15,000 samples from 4.0 Ga to the present. We find that the average Archean upper continental crust was silica-rich and had a similar compositional diversity to modern continents. This is consistent with an early Archean, or earlier, onset of plate tectonics. In the Archean, chemical weathering sequestered ∼25 % more CO2 per mass eroded for the same weathering intensity than in subsequent time periods, consistent with carbon mass balance despite higher Archean outgassing rates and more limited continental exposure. Since 2.0 Ga, over long (>0.5 Gyr) timescales, crustal weathering intensity has remained relatively constant. On shorter timescales over the Phanerozoic, weathering intensity is correlated to global climate state, consistent with a weathering feedback acting in response to changes in CO2 sources or sinks.	https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.2109		https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/qhtb6			Lipp-etal-2021

(2021). Curation and Analysis of Global Sedimentary Geochemical Data to Inform Earth History. <i>GSA Today</i>, doi.org/10.1130/GSATG484A.1	Large datasets increasingly provide critical insights into crustal and surface processes on Earth. These data come in the form of published and contributed observations, which often include associated metadata. Even in the best-case scenario of a carefully curated dataset, it may be non-trivial to extract meaningful analyses from such compilations, and choices made with respect to filtering, resampling, and averaging can affect the resulting trends and any interpretation(s) thereof. As a result, a thorough understanding of how to digest, process, and analyze large data compilations is required. Here, we present a generalizable workflow developed using the Sedimentary Geochemistry and Paleoenvironments Project database. We demonstrate the effects of filtering and weighted resampling on Al2O3 and U contents, two representative geochemical components of interest in sedimentary geochemistry (one major and one trace element, respectively). Through our analyses, we highlight several methodological challenges in a “bigger data” approach to Earth science. We suggest that, with slight modifications to our workflow, researchers can confidently use large collections of observations to gain new insights into processes that have shaped Earth’s crustal and surface environments.	https://doi.org/10.1130/GSATG484A.1					Mehra-etal-2021

Recent attempts to establish the eruptive history of the Deccan Traps large igneous province have used bothU−Pb (Schoene et al., 2019) and40Ar/39Ar (Sprain et al.,2019) geochronology. Both of these studies report dates with high  precision  and  unprecedented  coverage  for  a  large  igneous province and agree that the main phase of eruptions began near the C30n–C29r magnetic reversal and waned shortly after the C29r–C29n reversal, totaling∼700–800 kyr duration.

It  is  our  observation  that  the community has frequently misinterpreted how the eruption rates derived from these two datasets vary across the KPB.The U−Pb dataset of Schoene et al. (2019) was interpreted by those authors to indicate four major eruptive pulses before and after the KPB. The40Ar/39Ar dataset did not identify such pulses and has been largely interpreted by the community  to  indicate  an  increase  in  eruption  rates  coincident with  the  Chicxulub  impact (Renne  et  al.,  2015;  Richards et al., 2015). Although the overall agreement in eruption duration is an achievement for geochronology, it is important to clarify the limitations in comparing the two datasets and to highlight paths toward achieving higher-resolution eruption models for the Deccan Traps and for other large igneous provinces. Here, we generate chronostratigraphic models for both datasets using the same statistical techniques and show that the two datasets agree very well. More specifically, we infer that (1) age modeling of the40Ar/39Ar dataset results in constant eruption rates with relatively large uncertainties through the duration of the Deccan Traps eruptions and provides no support for (or evidence against) the pulses identified by the U−Pb data, (2) the stratigraphic positions of the Chicxulub impact using the40Ar/39Ar and U−Pb datasets do not agree within their uncertainties, and (3) neither dataset supports the notion of an increase in eruption rate as a result of the Chicxulub impact. We then discuss the importance of systematic uncertainties between the dating methods that challenge  direct  comparisons  between  them,  and  we  highlight the geologic uncertainties, such as regional stratigraphic correlations, that need to be tested to ensure the accuracy of eruption models. While the production of precise and accurate geochronologic data is of course essential to studies ofEarth history, our analysis underscores that the accuracy of a final result is also critically dependent on how such data are interpreted and presented to the broader community of geoscientists.	https://doi.org/10.5194/gchron-3-181-2021		https://doi.org/10.5194/gchron-2020-11			Schoene-etal-2021
2021-04-20	The paleogeography of Laurentia in its early years: new constraints from the Paleoproterozoic East-Central Minnesota batholith	Tectonics	------	Nicholas L. Swanson-Hysell, Margaret S. Avery, Yiming Zhang, Eben B. Hodgin, Robert J. Sherwood, Francisco E. Apen, Terrence J. Boerboom, C. Brenhin Keller, and John M. Cottle	Swanson-Hysell, N.L., Avery, M.S., Zhang, Y., Hodgin, E.B., Sherwood, R.J., Apen, F.E, Boerboom, T.J., Keller, C.B., & Cottle, J.M. (2021). The paleogeography of Laurentia in its early years: new constraints from the Paleoproterozoic East-Central Minnesota batholith. <i>Tectonics</i> 40, e2021TC006751	The ca. 1.83 Ga Trans-Hudson orogeny resulted from collision of an upper plate consisting of the Hearne, Rae, and Slave provinces with a lower plate consisting of the Superior province. While the geologic record of ca. 1.83 Ga peak metamorphism within the orogen suggests that these provinces should be considered as a single amalgamated craton from this time onward, a lack of paleomagnetic poles from the Superior province following Trans-Hudson orogenesis has made this coherency di cult to test. We develop a high-quality paleomagnetic pole for northeast-trending diabase dikes of the post-Penokean orogen East-Central Minnesota Batholith (pole longitude: 265.8; pole latitude: 20.4; A95: 4.5; K: 45.6 N: 23) whose age we constrain to be 1779.1 ± 2.3 Ma (95% CI) with new U-Pb dates on the granites. Demagnetization and low-temperature magnetometry experiments establish the remanence of the dikes to be held by low-Ti titanomagnetite. Thermochronology data constrain these post-orogenic plutons to have cooled below magnetite blocking temperatures upon initial emplacement and to have had a mild subsequent thermal history within the stable craton with no evidence of any significant subsequent thermal overprinting. The similarity of this new Superior province pole with poles from the Slave and Rae provinces establishes the coherency of the Laurentia craton following Trans-Hudson orogenesis. This consistency supports interpretations that older discrepant 2.22 to 1.87 Ga pole positions between the provinces are the result of differential motion through mobile-lid plate tectonics. The East-Central Minnesota Batholith pole supports the NENA connection between the Laurentia and Fennoscandia cratons. The pole can be used to jointly reconstruct the paleogeographic positions of these cratons ca. 1780 Ma strengthening the position of these major constituents of the hypothesized late Paleoproterozoic supercontinent Nuna.	https://doi.org/10.1029/2021TC006751					SwansonHysell-etal-2021

Brenhin Keller, Blair Schoene, Jacob B. Setera, Jill A. Van Tongeren, and Paul E. Olsen	Kinney, S.T., MacLennan, S.A., Keller, C.B., Schoene, B., Setera, J.B., VanTongeren, J.A., & Olsen, P.E. (2021). Zircon U-Pb Geochronology Constrains Continental Expression of Great Meteor Hotspot Magmatism. <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i> 48 (11), e2020GL091390	The New England-Québec Igneous Province is considered to be a continental expression of Great Meteor Hotspot magmatism, though other geodynamic scenarios have been suggested. Existing geochronologic data lack the needed accuracy and precision to permit tests of potential causal mechanisms. We provide zircon U-Pb ages for four igneous centers and a suite of plate reconstructions and show that the duration between magmatism in each branch of this province is ca. 3–6 Myr shorter and ca. 10 Myr older than predicted if the spatial-temporal distribution of magmatism conformed to a well-defined age progression. However, in addition to uncertainties in plate reconstructions, variable regional crustal thickness or lithospheric topography likely played a role in mediating the rates of melt transport to emplacement depth and we therefore cannot reject the hotspot hypothesis. Our results place the best-available chronological constraints on continental magmatism associated with one of the oldest and longest-lived hotspots.	https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091390					Kinney-etal-2021

Gaines	Peters, S.E., Walton, C.R., Husson, J.M., Quinn, D.P., Shorttle, O., Keller, C.B., & Gaines, R.R. (2021). Igneous rock area and age in continental crust. <i>Geology</i>. doi: 10.1130/G49037.1	Rock quantity and age are fundamental features of Earth’s crust that pertain to many problems in geoscience. Here we combine new estimates of igneous rock area in continental crust from the Macrostrat database (https://macrostrat.org/) with a compilation of detrital zircon ages in order to investigate rock cycling and crustal growth. We find that there is little or no decrease in igneous rock area with increasing rock age. Instead, igneous rock area in North America exhibits four distinct Precambrian peaks, remains low through the Neoproterozoic, and then increases only modestly toward the recent. Peaks in Precambrian detrital zircon age frequency distributions align broadly with peaks in igneous rock area, regardless of grain depositional age. However, detrital zircon ages do underrepresent a Neoarchean peak in igneous rock area; young grains and ca. 1.1 Ga grains are also overrepresented relative to igneous area. Together, these results suggest that detrital zircon age distributions contain signatures of continental denudation and sedimentary cycling that are decoupled from the cycling of igneous source rocks. Models of continental crustal evolution that incorporate significant early increase in volume and increased sedimentation in the Phanerozoic are well supported by these data.	https://doi.org/10.1130/G49037.1					Peters-etal-2021
