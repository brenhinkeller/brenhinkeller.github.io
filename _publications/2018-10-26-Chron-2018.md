A model framework for the interpretation of mineral age spectra in stratigraphic context 

>Abstract: <br/>Chron.jl provides a two-part framework for (1) estimating eruption/deposition age distributions from complex mineral age spectra and (2) subsequently building a stratigraphic age model based on those distributions. Each step relies on a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo model. The first (distribution) MCMC model is based on the work of [Keller, Schoene, and Samperton (2018)]( https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.1826) and uses information about the possible form of the true mineral crystallization (or closure) age distribution (e.g., no crystallization possible after eruption or deposition). In this first model, the true eruption or deposition age is a parameter of this scaled crystallization distribution. The stationary distribution of this first MCMC model then gives an estimate of the eruption/deposition age. The second (stratigraphic) MCMC  model uses the estimated (posterior) eruption/deposition age distributions along with the constraint of stratigraphic superposition to produce an age-depth model.
